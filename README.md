# Robotic-Arm
The robotic arm project is to build a LEGO EV3 robotic arm and control it using a Myo Gesture Control 
Armband. The EV3 brick has to be connected with the Myo armband to get motions and gestures from the arm 
to the robotic arm to execute different functions and make certain movements.

There is more to read in the report if you're interested.
